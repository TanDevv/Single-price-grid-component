## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I will start with the style-guide.md file. Then I will try to gauge what fonts were used in which areas awhile making my --custom properties.

The one issue I had with this project was the main container. As the container shrinks to 320px width, the third section would disappear and even after modifying the margin and line-height for everything else, nothing really worked. I had an issue with the main container causing a vertical scroll effect after it shrunk to a certain width and I did not really know how to stop that issue. I had to change the margin for the main container and other elements to finally stop it but I was 50/50 on my solution. If anybody has suggestions what I was failing to see, it would be very helpful!

This also gave me more grid practice as I did not want to use flex for much except the price span. :)
